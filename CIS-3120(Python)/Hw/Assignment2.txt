#1. Use the appropriate Pandas method to describe the characteristics of your dataset.
print("Here is the characteristics: ")
print(file.info())


#2. Count and show the number of apps in each category (or genre)
# Select the Genre only from the table and show the number of each category
print("The Genre only from the table are:")
print(file["Genre"].value_counts())




#3. Show all statistics (min, max, std, count and quartiles) of user ratings (out of 5) and size in same table
print("The statistics of user ratings and size are:")
#filter the Size and User rating into statistics 
file_Average_User_Rating_Size = file[['Average User Rating','Size']]
print(file_Average_User_Rating_Size.describe())
######if table is not shown on Jupiter notebook try this
#file_Average_User_Rating_Size.describe()



#4. Filter the dataset to count and show all paid apps with ratings under 1.5
#### Section A: Show the table
# filtering the paid app
file_Paid_App = file['Price'] > 0
file_Paid_App
# filtering the rating lower than 1.5
file_lower_rate = file['Average User Rating'] <1.5
#put two conditions together
test = file[file_lower_rate & file_Paid_App]
#Create table name, rating and price only
print(test[['Name','Average User Rating','Price']])
######if table is not shown on Jupiter notebook try this
#test[['Name','Average User Rating','Price']]


##### Section B : show the number of rows in the table (Please DO NOT PUT  Section A & B ####in the same Line)
# print the number of rows in the table
count = len(file[file_lower_rate & file_Paid_App])
print('There are', count, 'paid apps with ratings under 1.5')




#5. Write Python code to calculate which percentage of the apps 
#in the dataset are free. Do not change Nan values to zero. Print the percentage 
#on a 100 basis with no more than 2 decimals.
# finding the all numbers of value in percentage and keep the Nan values
# divided by the total number of Price including Nan Value(17007)
p = 100. * file['Price'].value_counts(dropna=False) / len(file.Price)
#print it as 2 decimals
print('There are',p.iloc[0].round(2),'% of apps in the dataset are free.')
